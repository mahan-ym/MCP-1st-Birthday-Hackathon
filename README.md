# Planning

1. We are going to use the Geocode api to get the latitude and longitude of the user
2. We can use google places api to get the near stores
3. We will see through the list of stores (Lidl, Aldi, Albert Heijn, Jumbo, etc) and get their offers from their dedicated links.
4. We do ocr on the brochure to get the offers
5. We will store the offers in a database
6. Finally we offer the user the most convenient offers based on their location and preferences
